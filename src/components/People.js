			<p>
				Frame One Software was founded by Christopher Powroznik and
				Spencer Gray in 2019. They got their start building agriculture
				software for local farmers around Vancouver Canada. Soon after
				one of their earlier apps gained viral success, they utilized
				that publicity to jump start Frame One Software and grow the
				business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Frame One Software's team was formed from the friends and
				colleagues of founders Christopher Powroznik and Spencer Gray;
				they have intentionally created a team that is full of skilled
				developers capable of building any modern project. The staff is
				composed entirely of Canadians living domestically. However, we
				provide services in all timezones and are able to deliver
				projects internationally.
