							<h5>Trusted Onshore Developers</h5>
							<p>
								Our staff is entirely based in Canada. Unlike
								many other software development shops that
								simply outsource projects and utilize overseas
								contractors, we hire and train all of our
								developers in-house. Frame One Software
								painstakingly trains each of its members to
								maintain a high level of quality and
								consistency. Coding practices remain consistent
								throughout all of our projects and everyone
								involved has a robust and well-defined skillset.
								We maintain our high level of quality, by
								creating a team of developers who are
								comfortable working with each other and are able
								to consistently deliver high quality products to
								our clients.

							<h5>Flexibility and Affordability</h5>
							<p>
								Frame One Software understands the modern day
								start-up. We know what it's like to bootstrap a
								business, because we've done it ourselves and
								helped dozens of our clients do the same. We
								offer a unique approach to payment that allows
								you to grow your business and product without
								breaking the bank. We offer affordable payment
								plans, where you can pay a fixed amount monthly
								until your bills are paid off, rather than pay a
								lump sum. This allows you to use the revenue you
								earn from your product to pay for the building
								of it. Our clients have utilized this strategy
								to build businesses with minimal initial
								investment.

								<p>
									We worked with GoldSpot Discoveries to help
									them develop a cross-platform mobile app to
									boost productivity for employees of mining
									companies. The app allows representatives to
									sign up on behalf of their company, and
									configure details such as team members,
									projects, and drill sites. Users within a
									company are divided into several categories,
									each with their own permissions and
									abilities. All of this is controlled and
									monitored in a robust admin portal we
									created for the client.

									SquareWon is a start-up entering the web3
									space with the vision of making
									cryptocurrency investment less scary and
									more accessible. They are establishing a
									robust suite of educational content centered
									around a fantasy crypto-currency portfolio
									system. Frame One Software built this
									extensive platform which allows users to
									manage a cryptocurrency portfolio using real
									market values in a safe fantasy environment.
									We built a system that hosts contests and
									competitions, to allow users to test trading
									strategies in a safe and secure way, without
									the need for an extensive knowledge of
									obscure wallet and blockchain tools
