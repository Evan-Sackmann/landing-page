					<h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
					<div className="info-item">
						<h5>Trusted Onshore Developers</h5>
						<p>
							Our staff is entirely based in Canada. Unlike many
							other software development shops that simply
							outsource projects and utilize overseas contractors,
							we hire and train all of our developers in-house.
							Frame One Software painstakingly trains each of its
							members to maintain a high level of quality and
							consistency. Coding practices remain consistent
							throughout all of our projects and everyone involved
							has a robust and well-defined skillset. We maintain
							our high level of quality, by creating a team of
							developers who are comfortable working with each
							other and are able to consistently deliver high
							quality products to our clients.

						<h5>Flexibility and Affordability</h5>
						<p>
							Frame One Software understands the modern day
							start-up. We know what it's like to bootstrap a
							business, because we’ve done it ourselves and helped
							dozens of our clients do the same. We offer a unique
							approach to payment that allows you to grow your
							business and product without breaking the bank. We
							offer affordable payment plans, where you can pay a
							fixed amount monthly until your bills are paid off,
							rather than pay a lump sum. This allows you to use
							the revenue you earn from your product to pay for
							the building of it. Our clients have utilized this
							strategy to build businesses with minimal initial
							investment.

						</div>
						<p>
							We worked with GoldSpot Discoveries to help them
							develop a cross-platform mobile app to boost
							productivity for employees of mining companies. The
							app allows representatives to sign up on behalf of
							their company, and configure details such as team
							members, projects, and drill sites. Users within a
							company are divided into several categories, each
							with their own permissions and abilities. All of
							this is controlled and monitored in a robust admin
							portal we created for the client.
